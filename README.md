# terminal-web

A web-based terminal: open a browser tab, get a real shell. The shell runs
inside a **tmux** session, so closing the window (or losing your network) just
detaches — your programs keep running and reattach when you come back. Open it
on your laptop and keep going from your phone — it's the **same live session**.

Built with [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) on the front end and a small
Node.js + TypeScript server using [`ws`](https://github.com/websockets/ws) and
[`node-pty`](https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty) on the back end.

It's designed to live on your **Tailnet**: the server binds to your Tailscale
IP and, by default, has **no application-level auth** — anyone who can reach the
address gets a full shell. To expose it more widely (e.g. behind a tunnel), set
an `AUTH_TOKEN` to gate access with a shared token. See [Security](#security).

**Features**

- **Resumable** sessions (tmux) — survive disconnect, refresh and sleep
- Deep **scrollback** (mouse-wheel, or one-finger drag on touch)
- **Multi-session tabs** — open (`+`), rename (double-tap), close-and-kill (`×`),
  restart (`⟳`); the tab list **syncs across all your devices**
- **Mobile layout + installable PWA** — compact top bar, a sessions drawer, and
  an on-screen key bar (arrows, Esc/Tab/sticky Ctrl·Alt, `^C`)
- **Copy & paste** that works over plain HTTP (no HTTPS required)
- **Attach any file** (button / paste / drag) → upload → insert path, for **Claude
  Code** and other AI CLIs
- Font size, fullscreen, IME (CJK) input, and a `?` help overlay
- Runs over **Tailscale** or any **LAN/intranet** IP; optional **shared-token
  auth** (`AUTH_TOKEN`) to safely expose it beyond your Tailnet
- Optional **background service** (launchd on macOS, systemd on Linux)

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone git@github.com:AaronFei/terminal-web.git && cd terminal-web
npm install      # needs Node 18+ and tmux (on Linux also: build-essential python3)
npm run build
bash scripts/start.sh           # binds your Tailscale IP and prints the URL
# no Tailscale?  HOST=192.168.1.50 PORT=8090 npm start   (or HOST=0.0.0.0)
```

Open the printed `http://<host>:8090/`. Want it always-on (start at boot,
restart on crash)? `bash scripts/service.sh install` (launchd on macOS, systemd
on Linux). See [Run](#run) and [Without Tailscale](#without-tailscale-lan--intranet)
for details.

> ⚠️ No login/auth — anyone who can reach the URL gets a full shell. Keep it on
> a network you trust. See [Security](#security).

## Architecture

```
                         WebSocket: /ws?session=NAME
                  binary = raw bytes, text = JSON control
  +-----------------+   <------------------------------->   +--------------------+
  |     Browser     |                                       |   Node.js server   |
  |   (xterm.js)    |  --- input bytes (binary frame) --->  |   ws + node-pty    |
  |  FitAddon       |  <-- output bytes (binary frame) ---  |                    |
  |  WebLinksAddon  |  --- {resize|ping} (text frame)  -->  |   spawns a pty     |
  |  WebglAddon     |  <-- {pong} (text frame)         ---  |   per connection   |
  +-----------------+                                       +---------+----------+
         ^                                                            |
         | static files (/, /styles.css, /dist/*.js, /dist/*.css)    | pty runs:
         +------------------------------------------------------------+  tmux new-session -A -s NAME
                                                                      v
                                                          +-------------------------+
                                                          |     tmux server         |
                                                          |  session "NAME" ------> | your shell + programs
                                                          |  (survives disconnect)  |
                                                          +-------------------------+
```

- The browser streams keystrokes to the server as **binary** WebSocket frames;
  the server writes them straight to the pty.
- The pty's output is streamed back as **binary** frames; xterm renders it.
- **Text** frames carry JSON control messages: `resize`, `ping`/`pong`,
  `restart` and `kill` (session control), and an optional `debug` trace.
- The pty runs `tmux new-session -A -s NAME`, so the same named session is
  reused (or created) on every connect. The tmux server outlives the pty.

---

## Prerequisites

These are CLI prerequisites — they are **not** bundled or installed by this
project:

- **Node.js 18+** (ESM, runs the server via `tsx`)
- **tmux** — the session backend (`brew install tmux` on macOS,
  `sudo apt install tmux` on Debian/Ubuntu)
- **Linux only:** a C/C++ toolchain + Python 3 to build `node-pty`
  (`sudo apt install -y build-essential python3`) — see [Install](#install)
- **tailscale** — **optional**. Only used to auto-detect which IP to bind to.
  Not installed? It's fine — set `HOST` yourself (see
  [Without Tailscale](#without-tailscale-lan--intranet)).

Development was done on macOS.

---

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

> **Note:** `node-pty` is a native addon. It ships **prebuilt** binaries for
> macOS and Windows, but on **Linux it compiles from source on install** — so
> you need a C/C++ toolchain + Python 3
> (`sudo apt install -y build-essential python3` on Debian/Ubuntu). On macOS,
> if no prebuilt matches your Node version it also compiles, which needs the
> Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`). See
> [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) if install fails.

---

## Build

Bundle the client (xterm.js + addons) with esbuild into `public/dist/`:

```bash
npm run build
```

This produces `public/dist/terminal.js` and `public/dist/terminal.css`
(esbuild derives the CSS file name from the `web/terminal.ts` entry, which
imports xterm's stylesheet). `public/dist/` is gitignored.

---

## Run

### Quick start (recommended)

```bash
npm start
# or, with Tailscale auto-detection and an auto-build if needed:
bash scripts/start.sh
```

`scripts/start.sh`:

1. Warns if `tmux` or `tailscale` are missing.
2. Builds the client bundle if `public/dist/terminal.js` is absent.
3. Detects your Tailscale IPv4 (`tailscale ip -4 | head -1`) and exports it as
   `HOST` (unless `HOST` is already set).
4. Runs `npm start` and prints the reachable `http://<host>:<port>` URL.

`npm start` alone just runs `tsx src/server.ts`; the server itself also
detects the Tailscale IP for `HOST` when `HOST` is unset, and logs the URLs it
binds (highlighting the Tailscale one).

Then open the printed URL, e.g. `http://100.x.y.z:8090/`.

### Without Tailscale (LAN / intranet)

Tailscale is **optional** — it's only used to auto-pick the bind address. From
a clean clone the only hard requirements are **Node 18+** and **tmux**. Without
tailscale, set `HOST` yourself:

```bash
git clone <repo> && cd terminal-web
npm install
npm run build

# bind to a specific LAN/intranet IP...
HOST=192.168.1.50 PORT=8090 npm start
# ...or bind every interface (reachable on all of the host's IPs)
HOST=0.0.0.0 PORT=8090 npm start
```

`scripts/start.sh` and `scripts/service.sh install` also work without tailscale
— they just warn, then fall back to the `HOST` you set (or `0.0.0.0`). Open
`http://<that-ip>:8090/` from any machine that can reach it.

> **Security:** there is **no app-level auth** and traffic is plain HTTP —
> anyone who can reach the bound `IP:port` gets a full shell. On a Tailnet that
> is limited to your authorized devices; on a shared LAN it's everyone on that
> segment. Only expose it on a network you trust (or put it behind a firewall).

### Development

```bash
npm run dev   # -> bash scripts/dev.sh
```

`scripts/dev.sh` runs the esbuild watcher (`node esbuild.mjs --watch`) in the
background and the server with reload (`tsx watch src/server.ts`) in the
foreground. Editing `web/terminal.ts` rebuilds the bundle; editing server code
restarts the server. The background watcher is killed automatically when you
stop the script (Ctrl-C).

## On-screen keys and the mobile keyboard

Hold an arrow button to repeat it: repetition starts after 350 ms and sends
one arrow every 50 ms until released. Repetition stops when the page loses
focus, the tab is hidden, the terminal session changes, or the connection drops.
Repeated arrows are not queued for reconnection. Ctrl/Alt modifiers still apply
to the arrow selected when the hold begins.

Shift is an independent toggle that uppercases the next typed ASCII letter;
tap it again to cancel. It does not add Shift to arrow sequences. Terminal
protocols do not send a standalone Shift press.

On iOS, opening the software keyboard pans the terminal only enough to expose
the active cursor. A prompt near the top stays in place; a cursor lower down is
brought above the on-screen keys. This also follows Safari's visual viewport
pan without changing the terminal grid merely because the keyboard opened.

## Input regression checks

```bash
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium --only-shell
npm run test:input
```

These checks load the real frontend and xterm.js in headless Chromium with
fixture HTTP responses and a recording WebSocket. They do not start the server,
a shell, or tmux. They cover Android's keyCode 229 + input events, predictive
composition, repeated Unicode input, paste, Backspace, reconnection during
composition, and the custom iOS and desktop input paths. Android viewport checks
also cover a fresh prompt, a cursor near the bottom, browser viewport panning,
layout/visual viewport differences, and navigation safe-area padding through
Chromium emulation. Opening the keyboard keeps the terminal grid stable, pans
only enough to expose the cursor, and places the on-screen keys at the visible
viewport edge. Chromium uses `interactive-widget=resizes-content`; the layout
also handles browsers that resize only the visual viewport.

The events and device identities are simulated; this does not replace a check
on a physical Android device with Gboard or on Safari. On a minimal Linux
workstation, Chromium also needs its system libraries (see Playwright's browser
installation instructions).

## Running as a background service (launchd / systemd)

To keep terminal-web running across logins and restarts (instead of a terminal
window you have to leave open), install it as a per-user service. The same
helper auto-detects the platform — **launchd on macOS, systemd on Linux**:

```bash
bash scripts/service.sh install     # write unit, load, start at login/boot + on crash
bash scripts/service.sh status      # show state + an HTTP probe
bash scripts/service.sh logs        # tail the service logs
bash scripts/service.sh restart     # after changing server code
bash scripts/service.sh uninstall   # stop and remove
```

`install` pins the node path, the repo path, and `HOST`/`PORT` into the unit.
By default `HOST` is your Tailscale IPv4, else `0.0.0.0` (override with
`HOST=… PORT=… bash scripts/service.sh install`). The service auto-restarts if
it exits, with a 10 s back-off so it doesn't hot-loop while the network (or
Tailscale) is still coming up at boot.

- **macOS:** writes `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.aaronfei.terminal-web.plist`;
  logs to `logs/launchd.out.log` / `logs/launchd.err.log`.
- **Linux:** writes `~/.config/systemd/user/terminal-web.service`, runs
  `systemctl --user enable --now`, and tries `loginctl enable-linger` so it
  survives logout / starts at boot (run `sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER`
  yourself if it couldn't). Logs go to the journal
  (`journalctl --user -u terminal-web -f`).

After editing **server** code run `scripts/service.sh restart`; after editing
**frontend** code run `npm run build` (the service serves the prebuilt bundle).

## How resume works

The pty doesn't run your shell directly — it runs
`tmux new-session -A -s NAME` (with `-A` meaning "attach if it exists, else
create"). So:

- **Disconnecting** — closing the *browser* tab/window, refreshing, sleeping
  the laptop, or dropping Wi-Fi — closes the WebSocket. The server kills the
  pty, which only **detaches** the tmux client. The tmux *server* and your
  session (every running program) keep going.
- **Reconnecting** opens a new WebSocket, spawns a new pty, and re-attaches to
  the same named session. tmux repaints the screen and you're back where you
  left off.

> Closing a **tab inside the app** (the `×`) is different: it *kills* that tmux
> session for good. So to keep a job running, just close the window or let the
> connection drop — don't press `×`. See [Sessions & tabs](#sessions--tabs).

The front end intentionally does **not** reset the terminal on reconnect, so
your local xterm scrollback is preserved and tmux's repaint lands cleanly. A
subtle "reconnecting…" overlay appears while it retries (capped backoff).

---

## How scrolling works

Scrolling is handled by **tmux**, configured in `tmux/web.tmux.conf`:

- `set -g mouse on` — mouse-wheel scrolling drops you into tmux copy-mode to
  browse history; scrolling back to the bottom returns to the live shell.
- `set -g history-limit 100000` — deep scrollback. Increase this if you need
  more lines retained (it costs memory per pane).

xterm.js also keeps a large local scrollback (`scrollback: 100000`), but tmux
owns the authoritative history (important after a reattach).

> The tmux status bar is hidden (`set -g status off`) for a clean full-screen
> look. To bring it back, comment out that line in `tmux/web.tmux.conf`, or at
> runtime run `tmux set -g status on`.

---

## On-screen keys & control bar (touch / iPad)

iPad/phone soft keyboards lack arrow keys, Esc, Tab, and modifiers, so the page
adds two bars:

- **Top bar** — session **tabs** on the left (see below) and, on the right,
  the controls that get used mid-session: `☰` (session list), `⌨` (toggle the
  key bar), `⟳` (restart the session), the **`1` `2` `⊞` split view** (see
  below), `⬇` (download a file from the host), `?` (a help overlay), and `⋯`. **`⋯` opens the actions sheet**, which holds
  everything that isn't reached often: font size (persisted), the split view
  again, restart, paste, **📎 attach a file**, download, and fullscreen. It is
  the same sheet the phone's ⋯ opens.
- **Selection bar (touch)** — dragging with **Select** armed no longer copies the
  moment you lift your finger. The selection stays up and a small bar appears
  above the key bar: **Copy** copies it, **Select all** extends it to the whole
  screen
  (of the terminal you are in — each half of a split has its own), **Cancel**
  drops it.
  Drag again to redo the selection before committing to it. **Copy the screen**
  in the `⋯` sheet does the select-all and the copy in one tap.
- **Bottom key bar** — `Copy Paste Esc Tab Ctrl Alt ← ↑ ↓ → Home End PgUp PgDn
  ^C | ~ / -`, horizontally scrollable. `Ctrl` and `Alt` are **sticky**: tap to
  arm them (they highlight), then the next key is sent with that modifier — e.g.
  `Ctrl` then `c` sends `Ctrl-C`; `Ctrl`/`Alt` + an arrow sends the xterm
  modified sequence.

The key bar shows by default on touch devices and is hidden on desktop; your
choice is remembered (on the server — see [What the server
remembers](#what-the-server-remembers)). Tapping a key keeps focus on the
terminal so the soft keyboard stays up, and the bar lifts above the iOS
keyboard via the `visualViewport` API.

---

## Sessions & tabs

Each tmux session is independent, and the top bar shows one **tab** per open
session (with a live connection dot). 

- **`+`** opens a new session (you're prompted for a name).
- **`×`** closes the tab **and kills that tmux session for good** (its programs
  are terminated). This is *not* the same as disconnecting — see
  [How resume works](#how-resume-works).
- **`⟳`** restarts the active session: kills it and reconnects into a fresh one.
- Open tabs and the active tab are remembered **on the server** and restored on
  reload — see below.

### What the server remembers

Nothing that has to survive lives in the browser alone:

| What | Where it lives |
|---|---|
| Which sessions are tabs, and their labels | the tmux sessions themselves (a `@twtab` option) |
| Font size, key bar shown, the tab you were on | `~/.terminal-web/prefs.json`, via `GET`/`POST /api/prefs` |

`localStorage` still holds a copy of all of it, because it is instant and it is
what the page can use offline — but it is only a cache. It has to be: embedded
in the a-fei launcher, this page runs in a cross-origin iframe, and iOS drops
that storage when the launcher app is closed. Every relaunch then looked like a
first visit — default font, key bar back to its default, and the first tab
showing instead of the one that was open. The server's copy is what actually
restores them now.

Prefs are kept per **device class** (`touch` / `desktop`), so a phone's font
size is not imposed on a desktop, and each remembers its own last tab. Writes
are coalesced (400ms) and flushed with `sendBeacon` on `pagehide`, so closing
the app right after a change still saves it.

### Split view: two terminals per tab

A tab can show a **second terminal** beside its own, and the `1` `2` `⊞`
control in the top bar (or **Split view** in the phone's ⋯ sheet) picks which
you are looking at:

| | |
|---|---|
| `1` | the first terminal fills the tab; the second keeps running out of sight |
| `2` | the second fills the tab; the first keeps running out of sight |
| `⊞` | both at once — side by side on a wide screen, stacked below ~760px |

The second terminal is **a tmux session of its own**, named after the first:
`work` has `work__b`. It is created the first time you press `2` or `⊞` — by
attaching to it, the same `new-session -A` every tab uses, so nothing is asked
of tmux beyond that — and a tab you never split never makes one. The `__b`
suffix is reserved: a session named that way is shown as part of the tab it is
named after rather than as a tab of its own, and closing that tab (`×`) kills
both halves. Switching between `1`, `2` and `⊞` never closes anything.

**Why two sessions and not one tmux split.** It was tmux's own split until
2026-09-22: one window, two panes, drawn into a single terminal grid with the
divider as a column of characters inside it. tmux sends only differences, so
once that grid and tmux's model of it drifted apart the border stayed drawn a
column or two off on a few rows for as long as the page was open, and
everything downstream had to know where that column was — selections were
clipped to one side of it through xterm's private selection service, and every
resize forced a full repaint. Two sessions have no shared border to get wrong:
each gets its own pty at its own size, its own selection and its own clipboard,
and the gap between them is a CSS gap. The ring round one half shows which of
the two the keyboard, the key bar and an uploaded file are going to.

What this does not cover is a split made **inside** tmux (`Ctrl-b %`, or a
program that splits itself). That is still one window in one grid, drawn by
tmux, border and all.

Which halves a tab is showing is remembered **per device** — a phone and a
desktop looking at the same work want different answers — rather than read back
from tmux as it was before.

You can also pick the session for a fresh page with the `session` query
parameter (handy for bookmarks/links):

```
http://<host>:<port>/?session=work
```

Without `?session=`, the default (`DEFAULT_SESSION`, default `web`) is used.
Names are sanitized to `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}`; anything invalid falls back to
`web`.

---

## Copy, paste & clipboard

The browser Clipboard **API** needs a *secure context* (HTTPS or
`http://localhost`), so over a plain `http://<ip>` URL it's blocked. This app
works around that so you don't strictly need HTTPS:

- **Select** — tmux mouse mode owns plain dragging, so hold **Option** (macOS)
  or **Shift** (Windows/Linux) and drag to select. Selecting copies
  automatically (via `execCommand`, which works over HTTP), or tap **Copy**.
- **Paste** — on a desktop, click the terminal and press **⌘V** /
  **Ctrl+Shift+V** (the native paste works over HTTP). On touch/HTTP, tap
  **Paste** in the key bar: a small box pops up, you paste into it, and it's
  sent to the terminal.
- On HTTPS (e.g. `tailscale serve`) the Clipboard API is unlocked and the
  Copy/Paste buttons work directly everywhere, including iPad.

The `?` help overlay summarizes these (with the right keys for your OS).

---

## Environment variables

All are optional. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` to override defaults. `.env` is
loaded by `scripts/start.sh` and `scripts/dev.sh` (`npm run dev`). Running
`npm start` (tsx) directly does **not** auto-load `.env` — export the vars in
your shell instead, e.g. `HOST=100.x.y.z PORT=8090 npm start`.

| Variable          | Default                                              | Description                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`            | `8090`                                               | Port the HTTP/WebSocket server listens on.                                  |
| `HOST`            | Tailscale IPv4 (`tailscale ip -4`), else `0.0.0.0`   | Address to bind. Set explicitly to pin a specific interface/IP.             |
| `DEFAULT_SESSION` | `web`                                                | tmux session name used when the client doesn't pass `?session=NAME`.        |
| `AUTH_TOKEN`      | _(empty = no auth)_                                  | Shared token required for requests arriving via Cloudflare; see [Security](#security). |
| `UPLOAD_DIR`      | `~/terminal-web-uploads`                             | Where pasted/dropped/attached files are saved (see below).                  |
| `UPLOAD_RETENTION_HOURS` | `72`                                          | Auto-delete uploads older than this (0 = never by age).                     |
| `UPLOAD_MAX_FILES` | `100`                                               | Keep at most this many uploads, newest first (0 = unlimited).               |
| `UPLOAD_MAX_MB`   | `25`                                                 | Reject any single upload larger than this many MB (0 = no limit).           |

---

## Attaching files (for Claude Code & other AI CLIs)

A terminal is a text stream, so you can't paste a file into it directly.
Instead there are three ways to attach **any file** (image, PDF, text, …); each
uploads it to the server (`POST /upload`), which saves it under `UPLOAD_DIR`
(default `~/terminal-web-uploads`) and returns the path, and the page then
**types that absolute path at the prompt**:

- The **📎 attach** row in the `⋯` actions sheet (a phone has a 📎 straight on
  its mobile bar) — pick one or more files. This is the most reliable everywhere
  (incl. iPad) and over plain HTTP.
- **Paste** a file (Cmd/Ctrl-V) into the terminal.
- **Drag-drop** file(s) onto the terminal.

The saved file keeps its original name and extension (sanitized, with a
`clip-<timestamp>-` prefix). So to hand a file to Claude Code (or any CLI that
reads a path): attach it, then press Enter — the CLI picks up the inserted path
and reads the file. Uploads are capped at `UPLOAD_MAX_MB` (default 25 MB) and
saved `0600`.

To stop the folder growing forever, uploads are auto-pruned on boot and after
each upload: files older than `UPLOAD_RETENTION_HOURS` (default 72h) are
deleted, then only the newest `UPLOAD_MAX_FILES` (default 100) are kept. Only
our own `clip-*` files are touched. Set either to `0` to disable that limit.

> The upload endpoint has no auth beyond the tailnet, same as the terminal —
> anyone on your tailnet can POST a file into `UPLOAD_DIR`.

---

## Security

By default **there is no application-level authentication** — anyone who can
reach the bound address gets an interactive shell as the user running the server.

- Keep it **Tailnet-only**: leave `HOST` pointed at your Tailscale IP (the
  default behavior) so the server is not exposed on your LAN or the public
  internet. Avoid binding to `0.0.0.0` on untrusted networks.
- Lock it down further with **Tailscale ACLs** so only specific devices/users
  on your tailnet can reach the port.
- **Exposing it beyond your Tailnet?** Set `AUTH_TOKEN` to a long random secret
  (e.g. `openssl rand -hex 24`). Requests that arrive **through Cloudflare**
  (detected via the `Cf-Ray` / `Cf-Connecting-Ip` headers it stamps) then require
  the token — open it once with `?token=…` to set a cookie; the WebSocket is
  gated too. Direct Tailnet/LAN access stays token-free. A static shared token is
  **not** a substitute for real auth (no per-user identity or MFA); for stronger
  control, front it with an identity-aware proxy (Cloudflare Access, Tailscale, …).
- The server speaks **plain HTTP** (no TLS), which isn't a *secure context*, so
  the browser's `navigator.clipboard` API is blocked. Copy/paste still works via
  fallbacks — see [Copy, paste & clipboard](#copy-paste--clipboard). For the
  native clipboard (and HTTPS), put it behind a TLS proxy such as
  `tailscale serve`.

Treat exposing this as equivalent to handing out SSH access.

## Troubleshooting

**`node-pty` fails to build / `npm install` errors with node-gyp**
`node-pty` is a native addon. Ensure you have a C/C++ toolchain:
- macOS: `xcode-select --install`
- Make sure your Node version matches what `node-pty` supports (Node 18+).
- Try a clean reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`.

**"tmux: command not found" / sessions don't start**
Install tmux (`brew install tmux`). The server spawns `tmux` per connection
and loads `tmux/web.tmux.conf`; without tmux on `PATH`, connections fail.

**Port already in use (`EADDRINUSE`)**
Another process holds the port. Find it with `lsof -i :8090` (adjust the port)
and stop it, or start with a different port: `PORT=8091 npm start`.

**Tailscale IP not detected / binds to `0.0.0.0`**
Make sure Tailscale is running and connected: `tailscale status` and
`tailscale up`. Confirm `tailscale ip -4` prints an address. You can always
set `HOST` explicitly to bypass detection.

**Client shows "reconnecting…" and never connects**
The server may not be running, or you can't reach `HOST:PORT`. Check the
server logs for the bound URL, verify you're on the tailnet, and confirm the
port isn't blocked.

**Blank page / terminal doesn't render**
Make sure the client bundle was built: `npm run build` (or use
`scripts/start.sh`, which builds it automatically). Check the browser console
for errors loading `/dist/terminal.js`.

**Garbled glyphs / blank terminal on an old or virtual GPU**
The WebGL renderer can misbehave on some GPUs. Append `?webgl=0` to the URL to
fall back to the DOM renderer (e.g. `http://<host>:8090/?webgl=0`).
